            Pseudocode: A set of instructions that a computer follows in order to perform a task
            Syntax: Rules that must be followed in order to construct a valid program
            Algorithm: A set of well defined actions for performing a task or solving a problem

            Object: Elements that contain both data and equations
            Procedural Programming: design using functions: group of instructions with a name, work together to do a job
            Purpose of a computer is to computer.
            Computer structure: Memory - Processor
            Compilation: Preprocessing , Compilation, linking
            Preprocessing: adds preprocessors with # 
            Compilation: Translates program into machine language code in an object file
            Linking: Combines and merges object files into single executable file.

            Hardware-Physical compenents of a computer
            CPU-runs programs, made of control unit/arithmetic an logic unit (ALU), does fetch/decode/execute cyle
            Main memory-Random access memory: work area where programs and data are stored
            Byte-enough memory to store a letter or small number, Bit- binary digit 0,1
            Address - identifies bytes
            Input-any data collects from outside world
            Output-any information the computer sends to the outside world
            Software-manages the basic operations of a computer
            application software-ppt,word,
            Statement: A complete instruction that causes the computer to perform some action
            Expression: Anything that has a value
            Operator: A symbol representing the action to be performed in an operation
            Operand: The data upon which an operation is performed
            Type: valid ranges of values, operations that can be performed on it
            Von Neumann: Fetch an instruction to execute, decode instruction, executre
            Strongly typed language: every type error is detected during compilation or runtime
            Type error: using a variable in a way that violates its type
            Precedence: the order in which you perform operations in decreasing priority
            Associativity: How to group operators operands w the same Precedence
            Variable: a place in memory, type
            Scope: range of statements that a name is accessible
            Scopes start and end with opening {} and closing {}
            Overflow: Variable assigned a value that is to big for its range type
            Overflow makes negative underflow makes positive values like 32767
            Pass by reference is ampersand&
            Vectors are created with (num elements, initial value for elements)
